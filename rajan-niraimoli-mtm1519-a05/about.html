            <h2 class=private>PERSONAL LIFE!</h2>
            <p class="para1">I'm Niraimoli(read Nirai), an ambivert who passionately creates new designs, clicks
                photographs and loves watching sunsets and goes on long walks in bad weather(please dont't try this). I
                inherited the talent to create designs from my mother, and the passion for clicking photographs from my
                father.
                I come from a humble family of five, me being the youngest of all. From my childhood until now everyday
                i have seen my mom creating new designs everyday which instigated the fire in me to play with designs
                and create new designs and the photographs that my father clicked they were pictures of fun moments of
                my family or just a nature picture which would look as if the scene at that particular moment has been
                paused and captured forever.</p>

                    <h3><b>BACHELOR'S in MASS MEDIA</b></h3>

                    <p>I did my Bachelor's in Mass media from SIES college Navi-mumbai, which is affiliated to the
                        University of Mumbai. It was fun travelling to college that was in another city meeting new
                        people on the way and making new friends...Ah here i go going off the topic. So coming back to
                        my degree, In the course of three years I learnt the fundamentals of Media management,
                        Marketing, Agency management, Copy writing etc.
                        Apart from eductaion degree college gave me an insight into the world outside of the four walls
                        of the college.The film festival organized by the college was one of the best thing my college
                        gave me. From being volunteer of the team that organized film festival in college to being the
                        core member of the same team years later for the film festival college gave me the chance to
                        sharpen my leadership skills. Also in my final year i had the opportunity to work as an Events
                        head for the CSR activity conducted by my college wherein we adopted a tribal school.</p>
